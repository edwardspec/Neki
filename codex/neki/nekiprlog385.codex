"As I put the twins in cryo, I could not contain my tears. I knew this was goodbye, but even in that moment they were still trying to cheer me up. They trusted me, and I was betraying their trust. I was sending them, all alone and helpless, to an unfamiliar and inhospitable place.

They will adapt and survive, without a shadow of a doubt, but will they be able to understand and forgive me?

Because right now, I can't even forgive myself. ^cyan;>>^reset;",

"We spent the previous night around a small campfire. They never liked fires, but seemed to feel safer while I was around. It was a good evening, filled with many positive emotions; but my knowing that it was to be our last made my every smile feel insincere.

Knowing that in just a few hours, we will have to part for good. Not being able to tell them. Tell them that they had to be sent far, far away just to remain safe.

All the way to the Human homeworld."
